# Film platform

I developed this website with a working login system thanks to JWT and JSON server. The JWT token is saved in the local storage to allow auto-login if the site is closed by mistake. When the token expires, an auto-logout is performed.
I also used my fake database to give the user the possibility to like the movies they prefer. According to the user who logs in, the favorites are dynamically retrieved.

I used Angular with SCSS, JWT Token, JSONServer, Angular Material, Angular Flex and Bootstrap.
